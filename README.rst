Files for the motor collisions data challenge

Challenge
---------
Given a data set of motor vehicle collisions in NYC over three years, predict how dangerous a given place is at a given time.

Deliverables
------------
A python script that takes as input a hidden test set and returns

1. predictions of danger for each row and
2. an evaluation of the predictions (in your chosen metric)

Make a folder with your name in the repo and drop your script in it.

Meeting
-------
On Wednesday (8/12) morning (10am) we'll gather to test out the scripts, and describe our models. Feel free to add to your folder anything that helps explain your model and code like ipython notebooks, plots, documentation, etc

Let me know
-----------
1. Your github username so I can add you as an owner of this github account, which gives you full privileges
2. Your slack username so I can add you to a data challenge specific channel. Use the channel to discuss these kinds of data challenges

Me is Gautam.
